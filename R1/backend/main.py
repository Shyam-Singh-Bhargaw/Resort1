Duplicate backend stub

This frontend copy of the backend has been backed up to:
  d:\\R1\\backend_backup

The canonical backend is located in the workspace root `d:\\resort_backend`.

To avoid duplicate code in the frontend repo, this file was replaced with a stub.
Use the API endpoints served by the backend instead of local backend files.
